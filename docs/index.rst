Django Statsd
=============

Integration between statsd and django. It allows you to use different clients,
sends timings as middleware and integrates with django debug toolbar.

Credits:

- jbalogh and jsocol for statsd and commonware, which I just ripped parts out
  of and put in here.
- robhudson for django-debug-toolbar

Installation
------------

From pypi::

        pip install django-statsd-mozilla

Because there is already a django-statsd on pypi.

Requirement, https://github.com/jsocol/pystatsd or::

        pip install statsd

Because there is already a pystatsd on pypi. This will be automatically added
when you install django-statsd-mozilla.

First off, pick your client, one of:

- django_statsd.clients.null

  This one does nothing, good for development. No point in wasting those UDP
  packets.

- django_statsd.clients.toolbar

  Use for the django debug toolbar, stores all the statsd pings on the request
  so they can be used in the toolbar.

- django_statsd.clients.normal

  Use this for production, it just passes through to the real actual pystatsd.

- django_statsd.clients.log

  Just writes the values to a log file using Python's logging module.

- django_statsd.clients.nose

  Route messages through to the nose plugin. This also works with the toolbar
  client, so you don't need to change them on -dev.

Usage
-----

To send timings from your code, use just like pystatsd, but change your imports
to read::

        from django_statsd.clients import statsd

For example::

        from django_statsd.clients import statsd
        statsd.incr('response.200')

Django statsd will choose the client as specified in your config and send the
data to it. You can change your client by specifying it in the config, the
default is::

        STATSD_CLIENT = 'django_statsd.clients.normal'

To send timings or counts with every request, add in some middleware::

        MIDDLEWARE = [
            'django_statsd.middleware.GraphiteRequestTimingMiddleware',
            'django_statsd.middleware.GraphiteMiddleware',
        ] + MIDDLEWARE

If you are using tastypie, you might enjoy::

       'django_statsd.middleware.TastyPieRequestTimingMiddleware'

To get timings for your database or your cache, put in some monkeypatches::

        STATSD_PATCHES = [
                'django_statsd.patches.db',
                'django_statsd.patches.cache',
        ]

You can change the host that stats are sent to with the `STATSD_HOST` setting::

        STATSD_HOST = 'localhost'

Similarly, you can use the `STATSD_PORT`setting to customize the port number (which defaults to `8125`)::

        STATSD_PORT = 8125

Toolbar integration
-------------------

Make sure `django_statsd` is installed::

        INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ..
                'django_statsd',
        )

This will show you the statsd timings in the toolbar::

        MIDDLEWARE = [
            'debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware',
        ] + MIDDLEWARE

Note: this must go before the GraphiteMiddleware so that we've got the timing
data in before we show the toolbar panel.

Add in the panel::

        DEBUG_TOOLBAR_PANELS = (
             ...
             'django_statsd.panel.StatsdPanel',
        )

Set the client::

        STATSD_CLIENT = 'django_statsd.clients.toolbar'

Finally if you have production data coming into a graphite server, you can
show data from that server. If you have one, link it up::

Here's the configuration we use on AMO. Because triggers and counts go
to different spots, you can configure them differently::

        TOOLBAR_STATSD = {
                'graphite': 'https://graphite-phx.mozilla.org/render/',
                'roots': {
                        'timers': ['stats.timers.addons-dev', 'stats.timers.addons'],
                        'counts': ['stats.addons-dev', 'stats.addons']
                }
        }

The key is added on to the root. So if you've got a key of `view.GET` this
would look that up on the graphite server with the key::

        stats.addons.view.GET

Django Model save and delete integration
----------------------------------------

You can log all create, update and delete events of django models.
Add to your Django settings::

        STATSD_MODEL_SIGNALS = True

Celery signals integration
--------------------------

You can log all the signals of celery along with the duration of succesful tasks.

To enable this, add the following to your Django settings::

        STATSD_CELERY_SIGNALS = True

Front end timing integration
----------------------------

New browsers come with an API to provide timing information, see:

http://w3c-test.org/webperf/specs/NavigationTiming/

To record this in statsd you need a JavaScript lib on the front end to send
data to the server. You then use the server to record the information. This
library provides a view to hook that up for different libraries.

First, make sure you can record the timings in your Django site urls. This
could be done by pointing straight to the view or including the URL for
example::

    from django_statsd.urls import urlpatterns as statsd_patterns

    urlpatterns = [
        url(r'^services/timing/', include(statsd_patterns)),
    ]

In this case the URL to the record view will be `/services/timing/record`.

Second, hook up the client. There is a un-sophisticated client called `stick`
included in the static directory. This requires no configuration on your part,
just make sure that the file `django_statsd/static/stick.js` is in your sites
JS.

Then call it in the following manner::

        stick.send('/services/timing/record');

We also include support for `boomerang`, a sophisticated client from Yahoo:

http://yahoo.github.com/boomerang

To hook this up, first add in boomerang to your site, make sure you use the web
timing enabled version, as discussed here:

http://yahoo.github.com/boomerang/doc/howtos/howto-9.html

When the script is added to your site, add the following JS::

        BOOMR.init({
                beacon_url: '/services/timing/record'
        }).addVar('client', 'boomerang');

Once you've installed either boomerang or stick, you'll see the following keys
sent::

        window.performance.timing.domComplete 5309|ms
        window.performance.timing.domInteractive 3819|ms
        window.performance.timing.domLoading 1780|ms
        window.performance.navigation.redirectCount 0|c
        window.performance.navigation.type.reload 1|c

There's a couple of options with this you can set in settings::

STATSD_RECORD_KEYS (optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A list of the keys you want to record, there's quite a few in the timing api
and you likely don't want to record them all. Here's the default::

        STATSD_RECORD_KEYS = [
                'window.performance.timing.domComplete',
                'window.performance.timing.domInteractive',
                'window.performance.timing.domLoading',
                'window.performance.navigation.redirectCount',
                'window.performance.navigation.type',
        ]

Override this to get different ones.

STATSD_RECORD_GUARD (optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There's only limited ways to stop people posting junk to your URLs. By defining
a this a function you can do some work to allow requests to your needs. If the
function returns None, the request is allowed through. If you don't want to
allow the request, return any valid Django HTTP response. For example to deny
everyone not in INTERNAL_IPS::

        from django.http import HttpResponseForbidden

        def internal_only(request):
            if request.META['REMOTE_ADDR'] not in INTERNAL_IPS:
                return HttpResponseForbidden()

        STATSD_RECORD_GUARD = internal_only

STATSD_VIEW_TIMER_DETAILS (optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The middleware sends timing pings for the almost the same thing three times
when accessing a view: `module.name.method`, `module.method` and `method` by
default. Setting this to `False` just does the former.

Logging errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to log a count of the errors in your application to statsd, you can
do this by adding in the handler. For example in your logging configuration::

    'handlers': {
        'test_statsd_handler': {
            'class': 'django_statsd.loggers.errors.StatsdHandler',
        },
    }

Testing
=======

You need to install tox_ to run the tests.
You can run the full test matrix with:

    tox

or choose a specific environment - let's say Python 3.4 and Django 1.11 - with:

    tox -e py34-django111

You can list all the available environments with:

    tox -l

.. _tox: http://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

Nose
====

There is also a nose plugin. If you use nose, then run tests, you'll get output
in your tests. To use run tests with the following::

    --with-statsd
